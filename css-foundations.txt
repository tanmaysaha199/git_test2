4 Basic selectors arranged based on their precedence

* Universal selectors
    * {color: purple;}
* Type selectors
    div {background-color:green;}
* Class selectors
    .class {text-alig: center}
* ID selectors
    # ID {font-weight: bold}


Grouping selectors
.class1, .class2{font-size: 14px;}
helps in applying font-size to both .class1 and .class2

Chaining selectors
.class1.class2{text-family = "Times New Roman";}
only applies text-family to elements that contains both .class1 and .class2

Descendant combinator
.ancestor #child {text-color: red;}
(nesting) only applies red to parent class1 having child id as id1

Rules for precedence in CSS 
* any no. of id selectors> any no. of class selectors >any no. of Type selectors > Universal selectors
* When no declaration has a selector with a higher specificity, a larger amount of a single selector will beat a smaller amount of that same selector.
* special symbols or combinators (+, ~, >, empty space, no space, *) do not add any precedence. 
* if an inherited item is specifically declared then it well get precedence over parent 
* Whichever rule was last defined is the winner in case every other factor is same.
