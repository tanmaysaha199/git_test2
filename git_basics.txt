Message writing convention for git

* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
    If applied, this commit will <your subject line here>
    eg: If applied, this commit will refactor subsystem X for readability       :Correct
    eg: If applied, this commit will fixed bug with Y     :Wrong
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
